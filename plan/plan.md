# Major Plan (A Plan)

Professional knowledge is core of following couple of years. Solid
professional knowledge is required. My expertise expanding in
following:


### 1. Fundemental Knowledge

Fundemental knowledge contains  *Data Structure*  and  *Algorithm*, more  *Data Structure*  should reference to  **Computational Geometry**  and  **MIT advanced Data Structure Course**. Algorithm states as  *Basic Algorithm*  and  *Advanced Algorithm*,  *Advanced Algorithm*  such as  **GC**  or algorithms in  *Machine learning*,  *Data Mining*, or  *Nature Language processing*, here I just mention  *basic Andlgorithm*:

- Specification
- Practical Skills






#### Minor Plan (B Plan)

B plan is design as backup of A plan, and it should serve me as **Financial
Best** as well as **Interests Best**. In additional. I believe this should
also be my **Captial Exponentional Grownth Plan (CEGP)** as well. Currently
Itargeting as following:

- Commerce Trade 
- Shock 
- Trading + Technology 

#### Bottom Plan (Z Plan)

Z Plan is the bottomline of entire couple of years. It should cover
following aspects:

- Finanical 
_ Opportunities
- Development 

**As for right now, it looks like I even don't for sure what's the plan
for next one year since H1B is NOT certain.**

#### Life-time Plan

I only have 576 months left in this world and should in no way to waste it.
Life-time plan go with month by month, currently I plan as following:

- A trip every month;
- A book every month

##### First Stage 
35 year old, middle-class, finanically ans socially. (96 months)

- Family 
- Insurance for parent

##### Second Stage 
Finanical Free

##### Third Stage
Enjoy my life

#### Interview
Targeting Aug. to Oct. for new job. No later than Dec. since we do need extra months to cover the H1B lottery. 

- Proficient in **one** language (C++)
